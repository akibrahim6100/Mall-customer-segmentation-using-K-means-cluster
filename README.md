📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Customer’s yearly income in thousand dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on the customer’s spending habits.
📈 Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (if any).
Feature scaling and encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing income, spending score, and age distribution.
Identifying relationships between features.
Clustering:

Implementing K-Means Clustering to group customers.
Choosing the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Visualization:

Plotting customer clusters for insights.
🔍 Insights
Identified groups of customers based on spending patterns and income levels.
Insights to help the mall target specific groups with personalized offers.
